# gjcsp-shifts-tracker
For the use of Gloria Jean's Coffees Springvale, this is a Shift tracker made using PHP and HTML. This aims to replace the paper system currently in use right now. This was an old project that I did as part of my requirements for my course on Software Development in Year 12. This repository aims to rebuild that project with my newfound knowledge on the subject.
